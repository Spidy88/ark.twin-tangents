<blockquote>
    <p>
        We strongly encourage players to record their raids.
        These videos can be used to determine if someone is making a false griefing claim against you or your tribe.
        More information on how to record sessions will be posted soon.
    </p>

<h3>General Rules</h3>

    <li>No cheating; This includes glitches, hacks, scripts or anything else that would provide you with an unfair advantage.</li>
    <li>No building inside of or blocking access to caves.</li>

</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Any action that is specifically targeted at ruining the work or enjoyment of other players without substantial gain to the offending player.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Base Building Rules (<%= link_to 'map', map_path %>)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You may not build a base on a large resources spawn (metal, kairuku, crystal, oil, etc...)</li>
    <li>You may not build a base in a cave or at an obelisk.</li>
    <li>You may not block paths to resources or obelisks.</li>
    <li>You may not reserve a location with pillars. Build something or not at all.</li>
    <li>Auto turrets on the outside of a base must have a 2-4 second warning. Please post warning signs.</li>
    <li>Turrets on the outside edge of your base (fence-line) must be set to low-mid range.</li>
    <li>Turrets on the outside of your base but positioned towards the interior may have high range.</li>
    <li>Turrets on the inside of a base need no warnings.</li>
    <li>You may not have turrets that will prevent other players from using paths to caves, resources, or obelisks.</li>
    <li>Mining shacks and forge bases may be build near large resource spawns (as long as they don't block part of the spawn)</li>
    <li>Mining shacks and forge bases may not have turrets on the outside.</li>
    <li>Mining shacks and forge bases may not block the path to resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Base Defense Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your passive dinos away from base walls, doors and out of the line of fire, or they may become an accidental casualty.</li>
    <li>Turrets may be used outside your base around the perimeter, however they must be set to a med-range and have a 2 or 4 second warning. These turrets are meant to let people know they are entering your area, signs should also be used to keep accidental fly overs from being shot down. Plant turrets are a great less lethal turret to use at your perimeter.</li>
    <li>Turrets inside your base do not require any warning and can be set to any distance.</li>
    <li>TIP: Keep boxes without pin codes so that raiders don’t have to destroy them to see their contents. These can also be used to place items in dropped cache that raiders don't want if they are nice.</li>
    <li>TIP: Look at your base from a raiders perspective. Are your dinos in a place a rocket or grenade might land? Keep dinos in a safe place, a raid may start any moment and you won't have time to move them (and attempting to leave your base may get them killed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Raiding Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Offline raids are allowed. These are raids done to tribes not currently online.</li>
    <li>No excessive damage to structures. The point of a raid should be to steal supplies not to destroy a base.</li>
    <li>Giga's may not be used to take down stone walls of a base as they cause too much excessive damage. They may be used against fence boundaries, dino gates, behemoth gates, and as bullet absorbers.</li>
    <li>Spectating a raid is allowed but not encouraged as you may become a target or considered a mercenary ally.</li>
    <li>No killing passive dinos. You may knock out passive dinos to search them for items.</li>
    <li>Only kill dinos that are not set to passive and are a threat to you.</li>
    <li>No interfering with the taming of a dino. This includes attacking unconscious dinos or removing resources to reduce effectiveness.</li>
    <li>If planning to kill players on the opposing tribe you must give a 30 second notice prior to raiding. This is meant to allow players to get off their favorite mount and make it passive if they desire.</li>
    <li>Allies may join in the attack or defense of a raid.</li>
    <li>Attacking allies should announce themselves for raids that use lethal force.</li>
    <li>Defending allies must announce themselves so that attackers know they are fair game. This must be done at the moment of the raid to avoid confusion.</li>
    <li>If any player or dino attempts to flee the base, they become fair game to be tracked, jailed, or killed while the raid is in progress. This will keep players from grabbing their best blueprints/items and running away from the fight.</li>
    <li>Turrets and Plant Species X must be set to reasonable limits when outside of base. Settings should be set to low/med range and high warning timer (2-4 sec) to prevent accidental flyer kills.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Cages are a great way to trap players while raiding. Using pin codes will allow you to leave and let them out from a distance. Do not leave players trapped in a cage after your raid.
    </p>

<h3>Kill on Sight vs Narc on Sight</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You cannot kill on sight unless your tribe and another tribe have both agreed you are in an ongoing war.</li>
    <li>You can narc on sight if you want to steal someones gear but remember, karma will catch up with you.</li>
    <li>You can not narc on sight if someone is taming or attempting to tame a dino.</li>
    <li>If you kill someone while attempting to narc them, you are responsible for saving their gear for them (you lose your chance to raid them) and you will get a 3-day no-narc on sight probation.</li>
    <li>If someone is attempting to narc you, you may use lethal force to defend yourself. Attackers may not go lethal, defenders may.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tribes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tribe sizes cannot be greater than 10 players total</li>
</ul>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Someone is spying on my base, can I shoot them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    No, but feel free to call them out in global chat and you might consider planning a counter-raid. Turrets around your perimeter can also be a great deterrent.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Can I blow up multiple entry points to their base from the outside?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Yes, but try to keep it strategical and not just excessive damage.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Someone killed my passive during a raid, will you ban them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Casualties can happen during a raid. This could be from a bad sniper shot, a rocket that went off course, or frantic stabbing at a nearby dino on neutral. Unless they have a history of killing passives we will not ban, but we will make a note of it for future instances.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This base is really well built, can I take out these four pillars and destroy the whole thing? It’d make breaking in way easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    No, that’s excessive damage. Find a way to raid their base without demolishing it completely.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>They destroyed all the boxes in my base, is that griefing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If the boxes were pin coded or near doors that could get caught by c4, no.
</p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>
    Punishment for breaking the rules will be determined by the administrators.
    We don't ban outright, so don't play afraid, but do play smart.
    Repeat offenders will be banned and any acts of direct griefing will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
    Play nice!
</p>
