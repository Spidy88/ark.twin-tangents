<h1 class='page-header'>Connecting to the Server</h1>
<p>
    Connecting to the ark server seems to have a weird hitch.
    When you add the server, use the ip with port 21116 and click search.
    You'll find the server, add it to your favorites.
    The game actually runs on port 21106 but for some reason adding it directly doesn't work.
