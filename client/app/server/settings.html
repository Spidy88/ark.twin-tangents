<h1 class='page-header'>Server Settings</h1>

<p>
    The game itself has great difficulty settings out of the box but we feel there are a few settings that could do
    with a little bit of tweaking to help even the playing ground for casual gamers and hardcore gamers.
    Below are the setting changes the server has.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Difficulty 1.0 (120 Max Lvl Dinos, same as official)</li>
    <li>Taming 1.5</li>
    <li>Experience 1.5</li>
    <li>Egg Hatching 1.5 (Eggs hatch 75% faster)</li>
    <li>Baby Maturation 2.0 (Babies grow up twice as fast)</li>
    <li>Mating Interval 1.5 (Get fertilized eggs less often)</li>
    <li>Character Hunger 0.8 (Official was 1.0, get slightly less hungry)</li>
    <li>Character Thirst 0.8 (Official was 1.0, get slightly less thirsty)</li>
    <li>Day time is twice as long</li>
    <li>Night time is half as long</li>
    <li>No Character Downloads</li>
    <li>Enabled 3rd Person View</li>
    <li>Modified day night cycle (see below)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The day night cycle is typically 28 minutes, we've increased this to 45. This means day time will be 30 minutes and night time 15 minutes. Open to changing this for better balance as the community sees fit.
</p>

<p>
    We will not be installing any mods during Ark's early access, however we will allow the community to vote on specific events/mods to keep the game interesting. Everyone wants to battle a dragon, we’ll summon one. Missed out on the dodo rex? Get enough people on the server to agree and we’ll add a special event.
