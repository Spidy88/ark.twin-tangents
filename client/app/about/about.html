    <p>
        The admins are here to keep the server running, enforce rules and make sure everyone enjoys the ARK. We cannot fix issues with ARK itself but can help people get unstuck and deal with minor issues that may arise after a server crash. Reach out to us on steam for the fastest response if we are not in game.
