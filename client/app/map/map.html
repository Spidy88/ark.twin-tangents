    The Center is a new map, and thus not much is known about it.
    When building your bases, use the following as guidance:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Are you building too close to a large resource spawn and your base will block the resources from respawning?</li>
    <li>Are you building defenses on the outside that will attack other players while they gather from major resource spawns?</li>
    <li>Are you building in such a way that blocks access to a large portion of the map?</li>
    <li>Are you building in such a way that blocks access to resource spawns?</li>
    <li>Are you building in such a way that blocks access to caves?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you can see, the general rule of thumb is, don't prevent access to major cornerstones of gameplay.
    Penguins, silica, oil, metal, crystal, obsidian, beaver dams, etc... are all considered major resources.
    If you don't know, just ask. Better to have an admin double check, then to be asked to move your base.
    Here's The Island map (before new caves were added) as an example of what was off limits.

<h3>The Island</h3>

    This is a rough map of where players can and cannot build.
    Red zones mean no building what so ever.
    Yellow zones mean mining shacks and forge bases are allowed by regular bases are not.
    It is not perfect, so please read the rules and use your best judgement when choosing a location.
    It never hurts to ask an admin to double check the location.
