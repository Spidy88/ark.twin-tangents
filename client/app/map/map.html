<h1 class="page-header">Construction Zones</h1>
<p>
    The Center is a new map, and thus not much is known about it.
    When building your bases, use the following as guidance:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do not block resources from spawning</li>
    <li>Do not build permanent bases in caves (temporary bridges ok)</li>
    <li>Do not build inside the obelisks</li>
    <li>Do not block access to large portions of the map</li>
    <li>Do not block access to resource spawns</li>
    <li>Do not block access to caves</li>
    <li>Do not block access to obelisks</li>
    <li>Do not try and reserve areas with random foundations. Buildings and fences only.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you can see, the general rule of thumb is, don't prevent access to major cornerstones of gameplay.
    Penguins, silica, oil, metal, crystal, obsidian, beaver dams, etc... are all considered major resources.
    If you don't know, just ask. Better to have an admin double check, then to be asked to move your base.
    Here's The Island map (before new caves were added) as an example of what was off limits.

<h3>The Island</h3>
<p>
    This is a rough map of where players can and cannot build.
    Red zones mean no building what so ever.
    Yellow zones mean mining shacks and forge bases are allowed but regular bases are not.
    It is not perfect, so please read the rules and use your best judgement when choosing a location.
    It never hurts to ask an admin to double check the location.
