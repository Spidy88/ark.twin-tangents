<h1 class="page-header">Construction Zones</h1>
<p>
    This is a rough map of where players can and cannot build.
    Red zones mean no building what so ever.
    Yellow zones mean mining shacks and forge bases are allowed by regular bases are not.
    It is not perfect, so please read the rules and use your best judgement when choosing a location.
    It never hurts to ask an admin to double check the location.
