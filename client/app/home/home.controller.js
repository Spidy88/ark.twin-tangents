 * First place wins a Box of Chocolates.
 * Second place wins a Helmet Skin of their choice.
 * Third place wins a potion of their choice.
        
**Update**

Turns out ARK Devs disabled Dune Buggies so we had Pig Races instead. Level 300 Phiomias max leveled in Speed. It was a blast! It also turns out Box of Chocolates can't be summoned either. Damn those ARK Devs!
        
Winners:

 * 1st. Cheeba (lvl 15 Quetz)
 * 2nd. dubvee (Top Hat)
 * 3rd. Spidy (no reward taken)

        let newEventsBody = `New events have been planned. I will continue my work on the website for user accounts, notifications, and better event descriptions. For now, the below have been planned:

##### Gathering Boost (3x)
Just like it says, resource gathering will be boosted for 24 hours. 
The rate will be 3x the normal rate. 
I'd make it shorter but I want to make sure every timezone gets a chance to capitalize.

##### Mega Summon
There will be a few kinds of summoning events. 
The mega summon is an event in which I summon dinosaurs outside the games normal spawn levels. 
For example, summoning a level 200 Spino to be tamed or killed. The locations will be random. 
Only some of the locations will be broadcasted, meaning exploration is your best option. 
A list of summoned dinos will be provided so you at least know what you are looking for.

##### Galli Lava Race
Similar to the Pig Races, we'll be riding Gallimimus. 
I'll spawn in some level 300 Galli's and boost their speed.
It will be dangerous but oh so fun and the rewards are always worth it.
Rewards will be announced later as the event draws closer.

Got an event you'd like to see happen? Ping Spidy and he'll see about getting it on the calendar.`;
