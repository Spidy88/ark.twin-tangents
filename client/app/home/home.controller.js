 * First place wins a Box of Chocolates.
 * Second place wins a Helmet Skin of their choice.
 * Third place wins a potion of their choice.
        
**Update**

Turns out ARK Devs disabled Dune Buggies so we had Pig Races instead. Level 300 Phiomias max leveled in Speed. It was a blast! It also turns out Box of Chocolates can't be summoned either. Damn those ARK Devs!
        
Winners:

 * 1st. Cheeba (lvl 15 Quetz)
 * 2nd. dubvee (Top Hat)
 * 3rd. Spidy (no reward taken)

        let newEventsBody = `New events have been planned. I will continue my work on the website for user accounts, notifications, and better event descriptions. For now, the below have been planned:

##### Gathering Boost (3x)
Just like it says, resource gathering will be boosted for 24 hours. 
The rate will be 3x the normal rate. 
I'd make it shorter but I want to make sure every timezone gets a chance to capitalize.

##### Mega Summon
There will be a few kinds of summoning events. 
The mega summon is an event in which I summon dinosaurs outside the games normal spawn levels. 
For example, summoning a level 200 Spino to be tamed or killed. The locations will be random. 
Only some of the locations will be broadcasted, meaning exploration is your best option. 
A list of summoned dinos will be provided so you at least know what you are looking for.

##### Galli Lava Race
Similar to the Pig Races, we'll be riding Gallimimus. 
I'll spawn in some level 300 Galli's and boost their speed.
It will be dangerous but oh so fun and the rewards are always worth it.
Rewards will be announced later as the event draws closer.

Got an event you'd like to see happen? Ping Spidy and he'll see about getting it on the calendar.`;

        let redditPostBody = `Our usual post to Reddit has been created.
Let's see if we can be the number one thread again!
If you are enjoying the server please do us a favor and upvote our post.
It pushes us to the top of the list so we get noticed more often.

Make sure you press the upvote on the comment, not the upvote on the main thread.

        let serverDownBody = `Our host took the server down for "Emergency Data Migration". 
Apparently the hard drives were failing.

**The good news:**
 * The new server will be on better, faster, and more performant hardware
 
**The bad news:**
 * It is estimated to be down for 8 hours
 * The IP address will change
 * The port number will change
 
As soon as I have the new information, I will get it posted to this website.
We'll handle the backlash of lost items, dinos, and deaths as best we can once we see what state the server is in once its back up.
Thanks for your patience!`;

        let serverUpBody = `Looks like our host is done with maintenance.
I say "looks like" because they never actually emailed me to say it was done, but my account has been unflagged :| .
To give everyone the best chance of survival, I will not turn the server back on until 9pm PST.
That gives you 1 hour to look up the new IP and prepare to login.
It's the best I can do, given the circumstances.
We'll do our best to fix any issues caused by the outage.

**REMEMBER**

The IP has changed. 
I've updated it on the website but you won't be able to search it until the server gets turned on at 9PM PST.
I don't know if this migration fixed the "search" problem, so checkout the "How to Connect" page if you have issues.
Just remember to use the new IP in the outlined steps.

Enjoy the Ark!`;

let olympicBoostBody = `To celebrate the olympics we're having a massive boost event! 
We're merging our regular Gathering Boost with our Dino Boost and sprinkling on a bit of XP Boost. 
Enjoy!

**Rates:**

* XP: 2.5x
* Tame: 2.5x
* Hatch: 4.0x
* Mature: 4.0x
* Gather: 3.0x`;
