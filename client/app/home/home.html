<h1 class='page-header'>Welcome to Twin Tangent's Ark Server</h1>
<p>
    We're a small group of game enthusiasts that despise griefers, trolls, and negative influences.
    If you aren't one of those, please come and enjoy our servers!
    We've been up and running for a few months now with great success.
    The community and response to our mission has been fantastic.
    We're free to play but can only foot so many of the costs ourselves, so if you love what we do <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tylerferraro">contribute back</a>.
    All money goes to faster servers, more slots, and more hosted games.
